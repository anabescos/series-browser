# Final evaluation - module 2 JavaScript 

The purpose of this project is to build a series browser, which can display a list with the result of the search and another list with the favourite series. This second list gets created once you click on each card of the main list, and the information is saved on local storage. In order to populate my data base, I ran a fetch request to pull information from an API.

This project was developed with the "Adalab starter kit", provided in the course.
